        <section class="section-wrapper section-green" id="selection-criteria">
            <h2 class="section-heading">Selection Criteria</h2>
            <h3 style="color: #ffffff">We Value</h3>
            <p class="section-text">In terms of the <em><span class="underline">overarching themes or values</span></em> in the proposals, we look at the following criteria during selection:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><b>Diversity</b> &nbsp;- As a conference, we want to be more <span class="underline">inclusive</span> (different approaches, different tools/techniques, gender, countries, back-ground etc.)</li>
                <li><b>Balance</b> - We want to strike a good balance between <span class="underline">different types of presentations</span> (expert talks, experience reports, tutorials, workshops, etc.) and <span class="underline">different types of experience</span> the speakers bring to the&nbsp;conference.</li>
                <li><b>Equality</b> - We encourage <span class="underline">more students and women speakers</span>. We won't select any proposal just because it came from a student or a women speaker. But given we have to pick 1 out of 2 equal proposal, we'll pick the one, which was proposed by a student or a women speaker.</li>
                <li><b>Practicality</b> - People come to a conference to <span class="underline">learn, network, have an experience and leave motivated</span>. Proposals which directly help this are always preferred. While a little bit of theory is good, but if the proposal lacks practical application, it does not really help the participants. Also people learn more by doing rather than listening. If proposals has an element of "<span class="underline">learn by doing</span>" it wins over other proposals. Take people on a learning journey.</li>
                <li><b>Opportunity</b> - While we want to ensure the conference has at least 70% rock solid speakers, we also want to give an opportunity to <span class="underline">new speakers</span>, who have real&nbsp;potential</li>
                <li><b>Originality</b> - Original ideas wins hands-on from copied one. People always prefer listing to an <span class="underline">idea from its creator</span> rather than second or third person. However, you might have taken an idea and tweaked it in your context. You would have gained an insight by doing so. And certainly all of us want to hear your <span class="underline">first-hand experience</span>, even though you were not the creator of the original idea. We are looking for <span class="underline">Thought-Leadership</span>.</li>
                <li><b>Radical Ideas</b> - We really respect people, who want to <span class="underline">push the boundaries and challenge the status quo</span>. We have a soft-corner for <span class="underline">unconventional ideas</span>&nbsp;and will try our best to support them and&nbsp;bring awareness to their work.</li>
                <li><b>Demand</b> - <span class="underline">Likes</span> on a proposal and <span class="underline">buzz on social media</span> gives us an idea of how many people are really interested in the topic. (We fully understand votes can be gamed, but we've a system that can eliminate some bogus votes and use different types of patterns to give us a decent sense of the real demand.)</li>
